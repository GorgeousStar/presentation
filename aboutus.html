         <h1> Hi! i'm Blessing</h1>
            <br>
            <p> My name is Blessing Innocent Edidiong. I am a Full stack developer based in Uyo, <br> Nigeria who loves coding and Artificial Intelligence. <br><br>

                I currently work as a web app developer at the Google team where <br> I build have several web app services and high value experiences related to Artificial Intelligence. <br><br>
                 I have a Bachelor of Science (First class) in Computer Science from the University of Uyo, Nigeria. <br>
                
                In October 2021, I published my first book called introduction to web for Beginners. <br>
                
                My non-tech passion/hobbies includes education & music, dancing and movies. <br> I believe everyone should be given a chance at basic education.
                in tech, <br> you'd probably find me working and listening to music with a headset on, or trying to play a game (and possibly failing at it). <br><br>
                
                I am also passionate about the developer community and I am trying to drive inclusion for more women in tech.</p>
                <br><br>
